The program is a simple Team Budget Planner Application. 

It has an index page with some simple HTML titles and two buttons that navigate to the respective
html pages that are listed on the buttons. One is for the Project Manager who can View, Edit, Delete, and Add new Projects/Deals to the pre-populated table. 


Secondly there is the Finance Manager page where the FM can edit the cost to add to an existing project.
